# Predicting Drug Review Response Times with Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a beginner project exploring **supervised machine learning** techniques to predict a **continuous variable**: the response time to Complete Response Letters (CRLs) in the drug review process.  
The goal is to build a regression model that can learn patterns from multiple input features and provide estimates of review response times.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Apply supervised ML regression methods (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
- Handle and preprocess structured input data.  
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²).  
- Document workflow and findings for learning and reproducibility.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib/seaborn (for visualization), jupyter (for experimentation)
